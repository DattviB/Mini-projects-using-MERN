FEATURES-
I have created my professional portfolio for Assignment 2 using different sections for different element in the same page. The certifications and projects are displayed in 
an image gallery with a text overlay sliding from the top as a hover effect. 

For easy accessibility, I have also included one back-to-top button at the bottom left, which gets you to the top of the portfolio page after clicking on it.
